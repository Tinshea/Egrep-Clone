CHAPTER I
The name of Babylon suggests one of the great centres from which
civilization radiated to other peoples of the ancient world. And it
is true that from the second millennium onwards we have evidence of
of Western Asia. Before the close of the fifteenth century, to cite a
single example of such influence, we find that Babylonian had become
the language of Eastern diplomacy. It is not surprising perhaps that
of writing for his correspondence with rulers of Babylon itself or
script and language for sending orders to the governors of his Syrian
should use the same medium for the reports they despatched to their
Egyptian master. In the same period we find the Aryan rulers of
Mitanni, in Northern Mesopotamia, writing in cuneiform the language of
discarding their old and clumsy system of hieroglyphs except for
while their treaties with Egypt are drawn up in Babylonian. In the
ninth century the powerful race of the Urartians, settled in the
mountains of Armenia around the shores of Lake Van, adopt as their
early period had, like the Hittites of a later age, substituted for
and later on they evolved from the same writing a character of their
own. Finally, coming down to the sixth century, we find the Achæmenian
kings inventing a cuneiform sign-list to express the Old Persian
proclamations and memorials beside those of their subject provinces of
of writing. But they have a very much wider implication. For when
a foreign language is used and written, a certain knowledge of its
largely religious in character, the study of the language carries with
of the race from whom it was borrowed. Thus, even if we leave out of
account the obvious effects of commercial intercourse, the single group
of examples quoted necessarily implies a strong cultural influence on
It may thus appear a paradox to assert that the civilization, with
a fact that for more than a thousand years before the appearance of
that city as a great centre of culture, the civilization it handed on
in his legislation, with an extended literature, and perhaps also with
by earlier models. If we except the spheres of poetry and ethics, the
been but little more than a provincial town. Yet it was reserved for
fortunes in detail it will be well to consider briefly the causes which
contributed to her retention of the place she so suddenly secured for
enjoyment of that position. The earlier history of the lands of
Sumer and Akkad abounds with similar examples of the sudden rise of
was continually shifting from one town to another, and the problem we
have to solve is why, having come to rest in Babylon, it should have
existence of three centuries, it must have seemed that their city was
events must have appeared to be taking their normal course. After the
country, with her abounding fertility, had been given time to recover
once more, according to precedent, under the aegis of some other
kingdom Babylon was always the protagonist, and no raid by Aramean or
the height of Assyrian power she continued to be the chief check upon
to the ephemeral authority of earlier capitals, and it can only be
explained by some radical change in the general conditions of the
country. One fact stands out clearly: Babylon's geographical position
must have endowed her during this period with a strategical and
to her material prosperity. A glance at the map will show that the
city lay in the north of Babylonia, just below the confluence of the
from the north the Mesopotamian plain contracts to a width of some
thirty-five miles, and, although it has already begun to expand again
of commerce. The Euphrates route linked Babylonia with Northern Syria
through the Taurus, along the track of the later Royal Road.[1] Farther
north the trunk-route through Anatolia from the west, reinforced by
and after crossing the Euphrates in the mountains, first strikes the
Tigris at Diarbekr; then leaving that river for the easier plain, it
southward to Susa or to Babylon. A third great route that Babylon
controlled was that to the east through the Gates of Zagros, the
outlet of commerce from Northern Elam.[2] Babylon thus lay across the
That she owed her importance to her strategic position, and not to any
particular virtue on the part of her inhabitants, will be apparent from
the later history of the country. It has indeed been pointed out that
the geographical conditions render necessary the existence of a great
had passed from Babylon. Seleucia, Ctesiphon and Baghdad are all
clustered in the narrow neck of the Mesopotamian plain, and for only
has consisted in the permanent selection of the Tigris for the site of
each new capital, with a decided tendency to remove it to the left or
eastern bank.[5] That the Euphrates should have given place in this way
channel and better water way, which gained in significance as soon as
so far from being a channel of international commerce, was as great
to Sargon of Akkad; but that marked the extreme limit of Babylonian
than a temporary occupation following a series of raids down the
Arabian coast. The fact that two thousand years later Sargon of
should have been so far out in his estimate of its distance from the
Babylonian coast-line,[7] is an indication of the continued disuse of
the waters of the gulf as a means of communication. On this supposition
when transporting his army across the head of the gulf against certain
coast-towns of Elam, and the necessity, to which he was put, of
in the swamp at the mouths of the delta.[8] But his object must have
to Herodotus[9] it had been opened by Darius after the return of the
Greek Scylax of Caryanda from his journey to India, undertaken as one
to suggest that Scylax coasted round, or even entered, the Persian
trade received a great impetus under the efficient organization of
the Persian Empire, it was the overland routes which benefited. The

now come into prominence for the first time, influenced Seleucus in
But that was not the only cause of Babylon's deposition. For after
her capture by Cyrus, new forces came into play which favoured a
transference of the capital eastward. During the earlier periods of her
history Babylon's chief rival and most persistent enemy had lain upon
Semites of Babylon found the chief obstacle to the southward extension
but even the sack of Susa by Ashur-bani-pal did not put an end to their
During all this period there was small temptation to transfer the
capital to any point within easier striking distance of so powerful a
Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean coast should continue to be the
chief outlet for Babylonian commerce. But on the incorporation of the
country within the Persian empire all danger of interference with her
eastern trade was removed; and it is a testimony to the part Babylon
innovations. The prestige the city enjoyed and the grandeur of its
temples and palaces doubtless also weighed with the Achæmenian kings in
their choice of Babylon for their official residence, except during the
or Ecbatana, and during the early spring, too, they might transfer the
capital. In fact, the city only lost its importance when the centre of
of the Tigris; and Babylon suffered in proportion. In the swift rise of
Seleucia in response to official orders, we may see clear proof that
which were shared in an equal, and now in even a greater degree, by the
The circle marks the limits within which the capital shifted from the
conditions produced by the Moslem conquest that Kûfa and Basra became
of Ctesiphon on the left bank of the river was a further result of
of the Arsacidæ, and, after the Parthian Empire had been conquered by
Ardashir I., it continued to be the principal city of the province and
the Moslem invaders defeated the Persians near the ruins of Babylon
and Seleucia to which they gave the joint name of Al-Madâin, or "the
cities," still retaining the importance their site had acquired in the
in the conquests of Islam, when, after the death of Mohammed, the
Arab armies poured into Western Asia in their efforts to convert the
world to their faith. The course of the movement, and its effect upon
established civilizations which were overthrown, may be traced in the
full light of history; and we find in the valley of the Tigris and
to that of the age before the rise of Babylon. The military occupation
of Mesopotamia by the Arabs closed for a time the great avenues of
transcontinental commerce; and, as a result, the political control of
the country ceased to be exercised from the capital of the Sassanian
into being around the permanent camps of the Arab armies. Following on
638 A.D., Kûfa was founded more to the north-west on the desert side of
later, and this arose in the centre of the country on both banks of
the Tigris, whose waters were then passing along the present bed of
importance, but during the Omayyad Caliphate Kûfa and Basra were the
Thus the slackening of international connections led at once to a
distribution of authority between a north and a south Babylonian
control, but from the economic standpoint we are forcibly reminded of
the era of city-states in Sumer and Akkad. Then, too, there was no
external factor to retain the centre of gravity in the north; and
Erech more than once secured the hegemony, while the most stable of
the shifting dynasties was the latest of the southern city of Ur. The
authority is removed to Baghdad at the close of the first phase in
dynasty and the transference of the Abbasid capital from Damascus to
to its old footing. Basra and Kûfa at once failed to respond to the
Ctesiphon, within the small circle of the older capitals;[15] and
that, with the exception of a single short period,[16] she should have
remained the capital city of 'Irâk. Thus the history of Mesopotamia
parallel conditions which enabled Babylon at a far earlier period to
no part. When she passed, the culture she had handed on passed with
of other races of antiquity which have come down to us. We shall see
of these periods of external contact was that of her First Dynasty of
resources, the country not only regained her independence, but for a
And in spite of her speedy return, under Persian rule, to the position
of a subject province, her foreign influence may be regarded as
The concluding chapter will deal in some detail with certain
features of Babylonian civilization, and with the extent to which
the latter connexion a series of claims has been put forward which
cannot be ignored in any treatment of the nation's history. Some of
the most interesting contributions that have recently been made to
Assyriologieal study undoubtedly concern the influence of ideas, which
earlier research had already shown to be of Babylonian origin. Within
that many features both in Hebrew religion and in Greek mythology can
only be rightly studied in the light thrown upon them by Babylonian
speculation on this subject, and to ascertain, if possible, how far it
or in part, it must be shown to rest upon a firm historical basis, and
of probabilities. The estimate of Babylon's foreign influence has
before considering the historical sequence of her dynasties, and the
periods to which they may be assigned, it will be well to inquire what

may well be derived from some official Persian document (cf. How and

spite of the total disappearance of the city, which followed its
gradual decay under Seleucid and Parthian rule, its ancient fame
sufficed to keep it in continual remembrance. The old Semitic name
the form Babil is still the local designation for the most northerly of
means "palace" or "castle," and when in the twelfth century Benjamin
of Tudela visited Baghdad, the Jews of that city told him that in
Mishael and Azariah had been thrown. It does not seem that this

that "the olde tower of Babell," which he visited "sundry times," was
really the ruin of 'Akarkûf, which he would have passed on his way to
of Babylon still extend for thirty miles. In fact, it was natural that

the earlier excavators should have fallen under a similar illusion so
far as the area between Bâbil and El-Birs is concerned.[4] The famous

domination of the Achæmenian kings of Persia, and from the time of
To fit this literary tradition to the actual remains of the city has
furnished a number of fascinating problems. How, for example, are we
to explain the puzzling discrepancy between the present position of
the outer walls and the enormous estimate of the city's area given by
Herodotus, or even that of Ctesias? For Herodotus himself appears to

impossible, Koldewey, for example, comparing the Great Wall of China
which extends for more than fifteen hundred miles, and is thus about
twenty-nine times as long as Herodotus's estimate for the wall of
that of the walls of Nanking, the largest city-site in China, and the
less than twenty-four miles in circuit, and the comparison does not
distance to the south-east of Babil. The traveller from Baghdad, after
crossing the present Nîl Canal by a bridge,[20] passes through a gap in
'Amrân-ibn-'Ali, stretching away in front and to his left.[21] The
whole length of the city-wall, along the north-east side, may still be
traced by the position of these low earthen mounds, and they prove that
in extent. The eastern angle of the wall is also preserved, and the
south-east wall may be followed for another mile and a quarter as it
doubles back towards the Euphrates. These two walls, together with the
of any importance still exist. But, according to Herodotus and other
seem to have disappeared completely on that side of the river. But for
the moment it may be assumed that the city did occupy approximately an
circuit would not have extended for more than about eleven miles, a
figure very far short of any of those given by Herodotus, Ctesias and

From this fact it is clear that a Babylonian citadel was not simply a
fortress to be used by the garrison for the defence of the city as a

There are two main reasons which suggested the identification of this
building with the Hanging Gardens. The first is that hewn stone was
on the whole site of Babylon where hewn stone is used in bulk for
building purposes, and that is the northern wall of the Ḳaṣr. Now, in
all the literature referring to Babylon, stone is only recorded to

latter's roofing, below the layer of earth, being described as made of
places them within the buildings by which Nebuchadnezzar enlarged his

Strabo and Diodorus than that of the Vaulted Building, the side of the
quadrangle, according to these writers, measuring about four times the
latter's length. But discrepancy in figures of this sort, as we have
The second reason which pointed to the identification is that, in one
of the small chambers near the south-west corner of the outer fringe of

constructed on the principle of a chain-pump. The buckets, attached to
an endless chain, would have passed up one of the outside wells, over
a great wheel fixed above them, and, after emptying their water into
a trough as they passed, would have descended the other outside well
for refilling. The square well in the centre obviously served as an
inspection-chamber, down which an engineer could descend to clean the
well out, or to remove any obstruction. In the modern contrivances of

Before the Neo-Babylonian period the Ishtar Gate had defended the

When clear of the citadel the road descends by a gradual slope to the
level of the plain, and preserving the same breadth, passes to the
of E-temen-anki, the Tower of Babylon.[117] As far as the main gate of
E-temen-anki[118] its foundation is laid in burnt-brick, over which was
an upper paving completely formed of breccia. The inscription upon the
slabs corresponds to that on the breccia paving-stones opposite the
of Sennacherib, whose name some of them bear upon the underside. This
earlier pavement of Babylon's Sacred Way must have been laid by that
kingdom. At the south-east corner of the peribolos the road turns at
a right angle and running between the peribolos and E-sagila, the
great temple of the city-god, passes through a gate in the river-wall

continuation of the procession-street. For not only was it the way of

road, running north and south through the city, was continued in a
straight line from the point where the Sacred Way branched off. This
would have conducted an important stream of traffic to the main

The first to be excavated was the little temple E-makh, dedicated to
the goddess Ninmakh, which, as we have already seen, was built on the
since the eastern entrance of the Ishtar Gate opens just opposite the
spanning the passage between temple and fortification.[122] The only
entrance to the temple was in the centre of the façade; and in the
passage-way immediately in front of it, surrounded by a pavement of
temple, though the altar itself has disappeared, the paved area which
surrounded it is still visible.[125] We may therefore conclude that
this represents the normal position for the altar in the Babylonian
cult; and it fully substantiates the statement of Herodotus that the
two altars of Belus were outside his temple.[126] One of these, he

of great size, on which full-grown animals were sacrificed. It was

erected in the outer court in front of the temple proper. Thus
of earlier altars of earth or unhewn stone,[127] stood before the
for Ezekiel refers to it as a "table," and states that it "was of
wood."[130] It was more in the nature of a table for offerings, and it
may be inferred that in earlier times it served as the table upon which
the shewbread was placed before Yahwe.[131] The complete absence of
any trace of a permanent altar within the Babylonian temples can only
off or burnt when the temples were destroyed. There is of course no
or borrowing. But we may undoubtedly conclude that we here have an
example of parallelism in religious ritual between two races of the
same Semitic stock. What the Sumerian practice was in this respect we
have as yet no means of ascertaining; but in such details of cult it
traditional usages for any other they may have found in the country of
or wash of lime, only the simplest form of decoration in black and
white was attempted, and that very sparingly.[132] The fact that the
practice of building in mud-brick should have continued at a time when
probably to be explained as a result of religious conservatism. The
exterior walls of E-makh resemble those of a fortification, their
intervals.[133] Larger rectangular towers flank the gateway, and two
others, diminishing in size and probably also in height, are ranged on
either side of them. The vertical grooves, which traverse the exterior
form of temple embellishment, which is never found on buildings of a
secular character. They may be either plain rectangular grooves, or
buried in little niches or boxes, formed of six bricks placed together
and hidden below the level of the pavement. The deposits found in
place are generally fashioned of baked clay, and that of most common
occurrence is a small figure of the god Papsukal. One of those in
Ninmakh's temple was in the form of a bird, no doubt sacred to the
goddess. There is clear evidence that the object of their burial was to
ensure the safety of the entrance both from spiritual and from human
foes. In addition to this magical protection the entrance was further
secured by double doors, their pivots shod with bronze and turning in
against the doors and with its lower end fitting into a socket in the
pavement. Since the temple was within the citadel fortifications, the

figures, no cult object was discovered. But around the dais for the

have been recovered by excavation. The "Great Terrace (or Court)," and

hands the necessary material for reconstructing the chronology on a
sound basis and extending it back without a serious break, into the
history is naturally of greater importance for the former, so far as
strict chronology is concerned.[2] But the information afforded, as to
her varying fortunes to their climax in Hammurabi's reign. This will
first to give some account of it and to estimate its effects upon the
contemporaneous with the First Dynasty of Babylon. The greatest of
these, Rîm-Sin, a ruler of Elamite extraction, was the contemporary of
Hammurabi, and his signal defeat by Babylon was commemorated in the
date-formula for the thirty-first year of the latter's reign.[3] This
victory was, indeed, the chief event of Hammurabi's reign, and at one
time it was thought that it freed Babylon once for all from her most
powerful enemy. But the discovery of a chronicle of early Babylonian
kings, while substantiating the fact of Hammurabi's victory, and
affording the additional information that it was followed by the
Another king of Larsa, Warad-Sin, formerly identified with Rîm-Sin, was
Kudur-Mabuk, and successively kings of the city.[5] The names of other
rulers were known from votive texts and foundation-records, and from
probably Sumu-ilum (a king of Ur), and Nûr-Adad or Nûr-Immer and his
son Sin-idinnam. It was realized that Sin-idinnam, the correspondent to
whom Hammurabi addressed his letters, was not to be identified with the
A complete list of the Larsa kings has now been recovered by Professor
A. T. Clay of Yale University, who is engaged in preparing the text for
and against the name of each ruler is stated the number of years he
occupied the throne. The surface of the tablet is damaged in places and
the figures against three of the names are wanting. But this is of no
great consequence, since the scribe has added up the total number of
and eighty-nine.[8] A most important point about the list is that
of the First Dynasty of Babylon. It is true that Hammurabi is one of
the three kings against whose names the figures are wanting. But we
already know that he conquered Larsa in his thirty-first year,[9] so
other by the short two-years' reign of Sin-iribam, the absence of the

But that fact would be difficult to reconcile with his survival into
Samsu-iluna's tenth year, which, according to the figures of the new
list, would have fallen eighty-three years after his accession to
the throne. That Rîm-Sin did survive into the reign of Samsu-iluna
by two date-formulæ which can be satisfactorily explained only on
that hypothesis.[10] Thus, if he ascended the throne of Larsa when
of possibility, but is hardly probable or convincing. We shall see
solution of the puzzle, to which another line of evidence seems to
as it undoubtedly is for the history of its own period, does not in
chronology of Babylonia. The relationship of the First Dynasty of
left in the same state of uncertainty as before. The possibility has
long been foreseen that the Dynasty of Nîsin and the First Dynasty of

That no long interval separated the two dynasties from one another
There were obvious advantages to be obtained, if grounds could be
consecutive but were partly contemporaneous. For, in such a case, it
would follow that not only the earlier kings of Babylon, but also the
into a number of smaller principalities, each vying with the other in
rule within its own borders. It was fully recognized that such a
succession at Nîsin, and our scanty knowledge of that period could then
possessed for deciding the inter-relations of the early Babylonian
of contact. The capture of Nîsin by Rîm-Sin, which is recorded in
looked upon as an event of considerable importance, since it formed an
as having brought the Dynasty of Nîsin to an end; such an assumption
certainly supplied an adequate reason for the rise of a new era in
time-reckoning. Now in the date-formulæ of the First Dynasty of Babylon
two captures of the city of Nîsin are commemorated, the earlier one in
that for the seventeenth year of Sin-muballit, the later in the formula
each of these dates from the capture of Nîsin by Rîm-Sin, and so
obtaining the desired point of contact.[15] But the obvious objection
to either of these views is that we should hardly expect a victory by
of Larsa have not proved very convincing. Moreover, if we accept the
earlier identification, it raises the fresh difficulty that the era
of Nîsin was not disturbed by Hammurabi's conquest of that city. The
detailed study has been undertaken of the proper names occurring on
contract-tablets from Nippur, and it was remarked that some of the
proper names found in documents belonging to the Nîsin and Larsa
and arrangement. The same witnesses, too, occur again and again on
possible, by the study of the proper names, to follow the history of
a family through three generations, during which it was living at
conquest of Nîsin put an end to the dynasty in that city. From two of
at Nippur not only under Damik-ilishu, the last king of Nîsin, but
that Nippur passed under the control of these two rulers within the
contemporary, and from the new Kings' List we have gained the further
information that he succeeded him upon the throne of Larsa. Now two
other of the Nippur documents prove that Ibkushu, the _pashishu,_ or
Damik-ilishu and also under Hammurabi in the latter's thirty-first
must have fallen within that of Rîm-Sin. We may therefore regard it as
certain that Rîm-Sin's conquest of Nîsin, which began a new era for
time-reckoning in central and southern Babylonia, put an end to the
reign of Damik-ilishu and to the Dynasty of Nîsin, of which he was
the last member. In order to connect the chronology of Babylon with
that of Nîsin it therefore only remains to ascertain at what period in
It is at this point that a further discovery of Prof. Clay has
of Rîm-Sin's reign, which bear a double-date. In every case the
first half of the double-date corresponds to the usual formula for
the second year of the Nîsin era. On two of them the second half of
the date-formula equates that year with the eighteenth of some other
the scribes in cities under Rîm-Sin's control had been in the habit
practice of early Babylonian kings.[21] But this method was given up
after the capture of Nîsin, and for at least thirty-one years after
that event the era of Nîsin was in vogue.[22] In the second year of the
era, when the new method of dating had just been settled, it would have
discontinued, the only possible way to make the equation would have
Hence we may confidently conclude that the second figure in the
double-dates was intended to give the year of Rîm-Sin's reign which
It may seem strange that in some of the documents with the
double-dates the second figure is given as eighteen and in others as
nineteen. There is more than one way in which it is possible to explain
year as the first year of the new epoch, others beginning the new

than ordinary ceremonial, and the date of its adoption would not have
likely that the explanation is to be sought in the second figure of
the equation, the discrepancy being due to alternative methods of
the years from his first date-formula would have made the second year
in their total the year of Rîm-Sin's accession to the throne, and that
according to the abolished system of reckoning.[23] This seems the
preferable explanation of the two, but it will be noticed that, on
either alternative, we must regard the first year of the Nîsin era as
One other point requires to be settled, and that is the relation of the

will be seen that precisely the same question arises with regard to
Though some features of the system are still rather uncertain, we have
formula for the year of its actual occurrence. Arguing from analogy, we

importance. We may thus regard the last year of Damik-ilishu, King of
Nîsin, as corresponding to the seventeenth year of Rîm-Sin, King of

We may now return to the difficulty introduced by the new list of
Larsa kings, on which, as we have already noted, the long reign of
Rîm-Sin is apparently entered as preceding the thirty-second year
of Hammurabi's rule in Babylon. Soon after the publication of the
chronicle, from a broken passage on which it was inferred that
Rîm-Sin survived into Samsu-iluna's reign.[25] an attempt was made to
explain the words as referring to a son of Rîm-Sin and not to that
ruler himself.[26] But it was pointed out that the sign, which it was
suggested should be rendered as "son," was never employed with that
continue to regard the passage as referring to Rîm-Sin. It was further
noted that two contract-tablets found at Tell Sifr, which record the
same deed of sale, are dated the one by Rîm-Sin, and the other in
there is a difference in the price agreed upon, the same list of
witnesses occur on both, and both are dated in the same month. The most
reasonable explanation of the existence of the two documents would

the transaction should still be recognized as valid, a fresh copy of

adopted, the alternative dates upon the documents, taken in conjunction
with the chronicle, certainly imply that Rîm-Sin was living at least as
late as Samsu-iluna's ninth year, and probably in the tenth year of his

It has already been noted that the Larsa List is a contemporaneous
at the time the document was drawn up. It is unlikely, therefore, that
any mistake should have been made in the number of years assigned to
separate rulers, the date-formulæ and records of whose reigns would
have been easily accessible for consultation by the compiler. The
be accepted as correct, for it does not come to us as a tradition
incorporated in a Neo-Babylonian document, but is attested by a scribe
writing within two years of the time when, as we have seen, Rîm-Sin was
the survival of Rîm-Sin throughout the period of Hammurabi's rule at
but had been retained there with curtailed powers as the vassal of
of dependence? In that case he may have ruled as independent King of
Larsa for thirty-nine years, followed by twenty-two years during which

Kings' List restored as suggested by Professor Clay, the figure for the

the discrepancy could only be explained by some such overlapping as

figures in the list. On such an assumption it is not improbable that
This explanation appears to be the one least open to objection, as it

would be precisely on the lines of the Babylonian Kings' List, in
without any indication of their periods of overlapping. The explanation

the Babylonian scribes. Moreover, we have evidence that at least one

similar period of three months was probably counted twice over both as
a late and not a contemporaneous document, but at least it inclines us
to accept the possibility of such an oversight as that suggested on the

reigns of Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna can be definitely ascertained by

the point is of some importance for the chronology, it may be as well
to cite one or two examples of this class of evidence, in order that
the anointing-priest of Ninlil, to whom we have already referred as
having lived at Nippur under Damik-ilishu and also under Hammurabi in
describe him as holding his priestly office, at Nippur. Now, if we
accept the face value of the figures in the Larsa List we obtain an
similar case is that of the scribe Ur-kingala, who is mentioned in a
document dated in the eleventh year of the Nîsin era, and again in
one of Samsu-iluna's fourth year.[35] In the one case we obtain an
interval of fifty years between the two references, while in the other
it is reduced to twenty-eight years. Very similar results follow if we
examine references on the tablets to fathers and their sons. A certain

those already cited may suffice to illustrate the point. It will
be noted that the unabridged interval can in no single instance be
The independent testimony of these private documents and contracts thus
converges to the same point as the data with regard to the length of
that is about one generation too long. They are thus strongly in favour
of the suggested method of interpreting Rîm-Sin's reign in the Larsa

that he revolted and took the field against his suzerain. It was in
that year that Tell Sifr changed hands for a time. But it is probably a
significant fact that not a single document of Samsu-iluna's reign has
been found in that district dated after his twelfth year. In fact we
shall see reason to believe that the whole of Southern Babylonia soon
passed from the control of Babylon, though Samsu-iluna succeeded in
retaining his hold on Nippur for some years longer. Meanwhile it will

earlier discovery considerable difference of opinion existed as to the

references to earlier rulers which occur in later texts, assumed a

sixty years, two other rulers with reigns of fifty-five years, and a

years credited to Rîm-Sin in the newly recovered Larsa List, which is a

been amply vindicated. The balance of evidence appears, therefore, to
be in favour of regarding the compiler's estimate for the duration of
In working out the chronological scheme it only remains therefore to
Hitherto, in default of any other method, it has been necessary to
rely on the traditions which have come down to us from the history of
Berossus or on chronological references to early rulers which occur in
the later historical texts. A new method of arriving at the date of the

the course of his work on published texts that had any bearing on the

Babylonian one, since that was definitely stated in its colophon. The
and by using them in combination Dr. Kugler was able to restore the
important discovery was that he succeeded in identifying precisely the
observations recorded. For he noted that in the eighth section of his
restored text there was a chronological note, dating that section by
twenty-one sections, he drew the legitimate inference that it gave him
a series of observations of the planet Venus for each of the twenty-one
for the heliacal rising and setting of the planet Venus. The date was
of her disappearance was noted, and the duration of her period of
in the west as the Evening Star, followed as before by the dates of
nor instrument for measuring angles was required. The astrologers of
the period would naturally watch for the planet's first appearance in
the glimmer of the dawn, that they might read therefrom the will of the
ascension, decline and disappearance, and then count the days of her
absence until she reappeared at sunset and repeated her movements of
ascension and decline. Such dates, with the resulting fortunes of the
country, form the observations noted in the text that was drawn up in
It will be obvious that the periodic return of the same appearance of
means for determining the period of the observations. But we obtain
of ascertaining the relative positions of the sun and moon. On the one

Dr. Kugler extended both the limits of the period to be examined; he
and her rising in the east, and, by using the days of the month to
ascertain the relative positions of the moon, he found that throughout
three times.[52] He then proceeded to examine in the same way the
rest of the observations, with their dates, as supplied by the two
tablets, and, by working them out in detail for the central one of his
three possible periods, he obtained confirmation of his view that the

It must be admitted that the last part of the demonstration stands in
the three alternative dates, there can be no doubt, if we accept the
accurate, that the central of the three periods is the only one
possible for Ammi-zaduga's reign; for either of the other two would
accession, and we thereby obtain a fixed point for working out the
chronology of the First Dynasty of Babylon, and, consequently, of the
partly contemporaneous Dynasties of Larsa and of Nîsin, and of the
still earlier Dynasty of Ur. Incidentally it assists in fixing within
comparatively narrow limits the period of the Kassite conquest and of
the following dynasties of Babylon.[53] Starting from this figure as a
basis, and making use of the information already discussed, it would
It will have been seen that the suggested system of chronology has
to earlier rulers which have come down to us in the inscriptions of
some of the later Assyrian and Babylonian kings. Hitherto these have
placed to date the earlier periods in the history of Babylon. In the
present case it will be pertinent to examine them afresh and ascertain
how far they harmonize with a scheme which has been evolved without
we may legitimately see in such an agreement additional grounds for
too slavishly to any calculation by a native Babylonian scribe, the
possibility of harmonizing such references at least removes a number of
difficulties, which it has always been necessary either to ignore or to
Perhaps the chronological notice which has given rise to most
discussion is the one in which Nabonidus refers to the period of
seven hundred years before Burna-Buriash.[55] At a time when it was
were partly contemporaneous, the majority of writers were content to
List and this statement of Nabonidus. Others attempted to get over the
difficulty by emending the figures in the List and by other ingenious
without explanation pointed to a possibility of error in any scheme
necessitating such a course.[56] We will see, then, how far the
was the contemporary of Amen-hetep IV., to whose accession most
historians of Egypt now agree to assign a date in the early part of
And by adding seven hundred years to this date we obtain, according to
as its evidence goes, the general accuracy of the date assigned to the
to the period of one of its kings which is found in the record of a
later ruler. The passage in question occurs upon a boundary-stone
which took place in the fourth year of Enlil-nadin-apli.[59] In the
predecessor of Enlil-nadin-apli upon the throne of Babylon. Now we
know from the "Synchronistic History" that Nebuchadnezzar I. was the
contemporary of Ashur-rêsh-ishi, the father of Tiglath-pileser I., and
we obtain approximate dates for Nebuchadnezzar and consequently for
In his inscription on the rock at Bavian Sennacherib tells us that
418 years elapsed between the defeat of Tiglath-pileser I. by
Tiglath-pileser was therefore reigning in 1107 B.C., and we know from
of Tiglath-pileser's father, may thus have come to the throne at about

events which took place in Enlil-nadin-apli's fourth year, and the

lower estimate of the figure's accuracy, its agreement with our scheme

the hegemony.[62] That Elam continued to be a menace to Babylonia
is sufficiently proved by Kudur-Mabuk's invasion, which resulted in
placing his son Warad-Sin upon the throne of Larsa in 2143 B.C. It will
be noted that Ashur-bani-pal's figure places Kudur-Nankhundi's raid on
Erech in the period between the two most notable Elamite invasions of
Another advantage of the suggested chronological scheme is that it

of rulers in the capital; but hitherto the available evidence did not
be worth while to point out that the date assigned under the new scheme

first dynasty of eighty-six kings who ruled for 34,090 years after

by Eusebius, to the effect that the Chaldeans reckoned their kings from
Alorus to Alexander,[69] has led to the suggestion that the period of
1910 years was intended to include the reign of Alexander the Great
(331-323 B.C.). If therefore we add 1910 years to 322 B.C., we obtain
2232 B.C. as the beginning of the historical period with which the

enumerating the dynasties II.-VI., Eusebius goes on to say that after

Berossus would have begun with the reign of the usurper Ukîn-zêr, who

The Elamite had seen his opportunity in the continual conflicts which
were taking place between the two rival cities of Sumer. In their
contest for the hegemony Larsa had proved herself successful for a
time, but she was still the weaker city and doubtless more exposed to
attack from across the Tigris. Hence her selection by Kudur-Mabuk as a
his two sons, Warad-Sin and Rîm-Sin, successively upon the throne
of Larsa, and encouraged them to attack Nîsin and to lay claim to
the rule of Sumer and Akkad. But the success which attended their
efforts soon brought Babylon upon the scene, and we have the curious
spectacle of a three-cornered contest, in which Nîsin is at war with
from Babylonian soil, may have played at first into the hands of the
Elamites. But it is not to be forgotten that the Western Semites of
Elam and Babylon must have foreseen that the capture of Nîsin would
prove a decisive advantage to the victor, and each was content to see
inherited the traditions as well as the material resources of the
between Babylon and a more powerful Larsa. Then for a generation there
ensued a fierce struggle between the two invading races, Elam and the
Western Semites, for the possession of the country; and the fact that
Hammurabi, Sin-muballit's son, should have emerged victorious, was a
and reflecting a claim to the suzerainty of the land from which his
northern foes at any rate boasted their origin.[76] Warad-Sin, on
ascending the throne, assumed merely the title King of Larsa, but
we soon find him becoming the patron of Ur, and building a great
fortification-wall in that city.[77] He then extended his authority to
the south and east, Eridu, Lagash, and Girsu all falling before his
arms or submitting to his suzerainty.[78] During this period Babylon

In that year Sin-muballit records that he slew the army of Ur with the
sword, and, since we know that Ur was at this time a vassal-city of
Rîm-Sin's command. Three years later he transferred his attention from
Larsa to Nîsin, then under the control of Damiḳ-ilishu, the son and
successor of Sin-magir. On that occasion Sin-muballit commemorates his
conquest of Nîsin, but it must have been little more than a victory in
In the last year of his reign we find Sin-muballit fighting on the
other front, and claiming to have slain the army of Larsa with the
sword. It is clear that in these last seven years of his reign Babylon
on the part of Larsa and the Elamites, and, by a continuance of the
policy of fortifying her vassal-cities,[80] she paved the way for a
more vigorous offensive on the part of Hammurabi, Sin-muballit's son
and successor. Meanwhile the unfortunate city of Nîsin was between two
periods, the first during the five years which followed his sixth year
to have inaugurated the reforms in the internal administration of
the country, which culminated towards the close of his life in the
promulgation of his famous Code of Laws; for he commemorated his
second year as that in which he established righteousness in the
acts being the installation of the chief-priest in Kashbaran,[81] the
building of a wall for the Gagûm, or great Cloister of Sippar, and
of Erech and Nîsin. This temporary success against Damik-ilishu of
Nîsin was doubtless a menace to the plans of Rîm-Sin at Larsa, and it
would appear that Kudur-Mabuk came to the assistance of his son by
the attack appears to have been successfully repulsed with a gain
of territory to Babylon,[82] the diversion was successful. Rîm-Sin
took advantage of the respite thus secured to renew his attack with
Rîm-Sin's victory must have been a severe blow to Babylon, and it would
seem that she made no attempt at first to recover her position in the
south, since Hammurabi occupied himself with a raid on Malgûm[83] in
and for nineteen years afterwards Babylon achieved nothing of a
and enrichment of temples. One canal was cut,[84] and the process of
of defence.[85] But the negative evidence supplied by the formulæ for
In addition to his capital, Rîm-Sin had inherited from his brother
the control of the southern group of cities, Ur, Erech, Girsu and
before. For in more than one of his inscriptions Rîm-Sin refers to
country.[87] The most notable result of his conquest of Nîsin was the
possession of Nippur, which now passed to him and regularized his
himself as the exalted Prince of Nippur, or as the shepherd of the
whole land of Nippur; and we possess an interesting confirmation of
his recognition there in a clay cone inscribed with a dedication
for the prolongation of his life by a private citizen, a certain
throughout the country as a whole, is attested by the numerous
commercial documents which have been recovered both at Nippur and
Larsa and are dated in the era of his capture of Nîsin. There is also
evidence that he devoted himself to improving the system of irrigation
traffic but increased the danger of flood and the growth of the
swamp-area. He also cut the Mashtabba Canal, and others at Nippur and
extraction and the intimate relations he continued to maintain with his
domination, which for so long had arrested any increase in the power of
the land of Emutbal, inflicting a final defeat on the Elamites, and
for many years, and to have given further trouble to Babylon in the
reign of Hammurabi's son, Samsu-iluna.--And the evidence seems to show
of Sumer, would have treated the old capital in the same way that
Sumu-abum treated Kish.[93] But it would seem that after a time Larsa
must have been deprived of many of its privileges, including that of
continuing its own era of time-reckoning; and Hammurabi's letters to
rule. We may perhaps assume that Rîm-Sin's subsequent revolt was due to
a favourable opportunity to make one more bid for independent rule in
sides. During these later years he twice made successful raids in the
all his enemies that dwelt beside Subartu. It is probable that he

such local West-Semitic kingdoms as that of Khana.[94] On the west we

the very exhaustive record of his activities which he himself drew up
as the Prologue to his Code. He there enumerates the great cities of

as the capital, comes third, and then the great centres of Moon-and
and Akkad, the king characterizing the benefits he has bestowed on
each. The list includes some of his western conquests and ends with
Ashur and Nineveh.[97] It is significant of the racial character of
his dynasty that Hammurabi should here ascribe his victories on the

of no Elamite ruler of that name, we have seen that Elam at about
this period had exercised control over a great part of Southern and
Central Babylonia, and that its Babylonian capital was the city of
Larsa, with which the Ellasar of the Hebrew tradition is certainly to
be identified.[99] Moreover, Kudur-Mabuk, the historical founder of the
of the Elamites, he was their principal antagonist and brought their

shall see presently, hastened by an invasion of Hittite tribes. Thus

in Western Asia which was not impossible during the earlier half of
achievements he added a genius for administrative detail, and his
letters and despatches, which have been recovered, reveal him as in
cities of his empire. That he should have superintended matters of
public importance is what might be naturally expected; but we also
see him investigating quite trivial complaints and disputes among the
humbler classes of his subjects, and often sending back a case for
which he drew up for use throughout his empire. It is true that this
elaborate system of laws, which deal in detail with every class of
work of Hammurabi himself. Like all other ancient legal codes it was
earlier collections of laws, it was based on careful consideration of
established custom. Hammurabi's great achievement was the codification
of this mass of legal enactments and the rigid enforcement of the
provisions of the resulting code throughout the whole territory of
Babylonia. Its provisions reflect the king's own enthusiasm, of which
his letters give independent proof, in the cause of the humbler and the

not so much in any claim to extensive originality, but rather on its
witness on the subjects with which it deals, and where it gives no
information, the letters and contracts of the period often enable us to
the higher officials and servants of the state, and the owners of
from that immediately below them. In fact, while the majority of its
members enjoyed these advantages, it was possible for a man to forfeit
standing and privileges. It would seem therefore that the distinction
was based on a racial qualification, and that the upper class, or
inhabitants, especially where these had thrown in their lot with the
invaders and had espoused their cause. It is even possible that some
of the latter had from the first obtained recognition in its ranks in
a middle class between the aristocracy and the slaves. They bore a
Sumerian element in the population, in part from the Semitic strain
The difference, which divided and marked off from one another these two
great classes of free men in the population, is well illustrated by the
of stealing an ox, or other animal, or a boat, which was private or
was also less if the assailant was a man of the middle class; he could
obtain a divorce more cheaply, and he paid his doctor or surgeon
a smaller fee for a successful operation. On the other hand, these
privileges were counterbalanced by a corresponding diminution of the
That a racial distinction underlay the difference in social position
and standing is suggested by the current penalties for assault, in
accordance with which a noble could demand an exact retaliation for
compensation to any man of the middle class he might have injured. Thus
if one noble happened to knock out the eye or the tooth of another, his
own eye or his own tooth was knocked out in return, and if he broke the
class, or broke his limb, he was fined one maneh of silver, and for
knocking out the tooth of such a man, he was fined one-third of a
strata, which can best be explained by a difference in race. Thus
if two members of the same class quarrelled and one of them made a

the assailant was punished by being publicly beaten in the presence of

had done so through being deceived by another man, that man was put to

to acquire property of his own, or a slave might inherit wealth from
consent to purchase his freedom. Again, if a slave were captured by the
enemy and taken to a foreign land and sold, and were then brought back
by his new owner to his own country, he could claim his liberty without
of a female slave had begotten children by her, he could not use her
as payment for a debt; and, in the event of his having done so, he was
obliged to ransom her by paying the original amount of the debt in
or by a member of the middle class, to marry a free woman, and if he
did so his children were free and did not become the property of his
master. His wife, too, if a free woman, retained her marriage-portion
during the time they lived together as man and wife, the owner of
being retained by the free woman for her own use and for that of her

still in communal or tribal possession,[7] a very large proportion was

was for the tenant to pay his rent in kind, by assigning a certain
who advanced the seed-corn.[8] The tenant was bound to till the

aggravated offence, would have sufficed to maintain respect for the

cut new canals and extended the system of irrigation and transport by
nearer the main stream, with the result that the bed of a canal was
constantly in process of being raised. Every year it was necessary to
rose higher and higher, until a point was reached when the labour

grandson, Abi-eshu', who describes a sudden rise of this sort in the
level of the Irnina Canal so that it overflowed its banks.[12] At the
time the king was building a palace in the city of Kâr-Irnina, which
was supplied by the Irnina Canal, and every year a certain amount of
little more than a third of the year's work had been done, when the

instructions to inquire into the matter and take steps to prevent any

canals, it will be obvious that some means had to be employed to
raise the water for purposes of irrigation from the main channel to
the higher level of the land. Reference is made in the Babylonian
to those employed at the present day. The most primitive method of

primitive forms of irrigation-machine, and that the Babylonians of
the First Dynasty merely inherited them and passed them on to their
successors. When once invented they were incapable of very great
improvement. In the one the skin must always remain a skin; in the
other the wheel must always be lightly constructed of boughs, or the

members of the upper class, and while they themselves continued to

at the present day; and there was always the additional risk that a
caravan might be captured by the enemy, if it ventured too near a
hostile frontier. In such circumstances the king saw to it that the

agent had been forced in the course of his journey to give up some of

for merchant and trader to share the profits between them, and, in

The town-life in Babylonia at this time must have had many features in
that the paternal government of the First Dynasty undoubtedly saw to it
in ancient Babylon,[30] and noted that, while the foundations of the
story, their flat mud roofs, supported on a layer of brush-wood with
the hot season. Contemporary evidence goes to show that, before the
heavy penalties exacted for bad work led to a marked improvement in
construction. For, when such a newly built house fell and crushed the
owner so that he died, the builder himself was liable to be put to
killed, the builder had to restore him slave for slave. Any damage to
the owner's possessions was also made good by the builder, who had in
addition to rebuild the house at his own cost, or repair any portion
of it that had fallen. On the other hand, payment for sound work was
guaranteed, and the fact that the scale of payment was fixed by the
area of ground covered by the building, is direct evidence that the
of town-planning on systematic lines, with streets running through and
crossing each other at right angles, of which we have noted evidence at
members of a family to one another were regulated by law, and
while the provision and disposal of marriage-portions, the rights of
upon traditional lines. Perhaps the most striking feature in the
social system was the recognized status of the wife in the Babylonian
by a duly executed and attested marriage-contract, and without this
Chastity on the wife's part was enforced under severe penalty;[32] but
on the other hand the husband's responsibility to maintain his wife in
The law gave the wife ample protection, and in the case of the
husband's desertion allowed her, under certain conditions, to become
the legal wife of another man. If the husband wilfully deserted her
and left his city under no compulsion, she might remarry and he could
this rule did not apply; and the wife was allowed to shape her action
affairs. The regulations in such a case were extraordinarily in favour
of the woman. If the husband was possessed of property sufficient to
maintain the wife during the period of his captivity, she had no excuse
for remarriage; and, should she become the wife of another man, the
marriage was not regarded as legal and she was liable to the extreme
penalty for adultery. But if the husband had not sufficient means for
his wife's maintenance, it was recognized that she would be thrown on
the woman's interests, and only dealt with her severely if it could
be proved that she had wasted her household and failed in her duty as
been none, he must make her an allowance. She also had the custody of
her children, for whose maintenance and education the husband had to
provide; and, at his death, the divorced wife and her children could

the married woman in the Babylonian community, which was not only
Still more remarkable were the privileges capable of attainment by
undertakings. To secure such a position a woman took vows, by which she

temple, they enjoyed a position of great influence and independence in
the community. A votary could possess property in her own name, and on
taking her vows was provided with a portion by her father, exactly as
and did not become the property of her order, nor of the temple to
which she was attached; it was devoted entirely to her maintenance, and
after her father's death, her brothers looked after her interest, and
to her own family, unless her father assigned her the privilege of
bequeathing it; but any property she inherited she could bequeath, and
she had not to pay taxes on it. She had considerable freedom, could

latter could brand her and put her with the female slaves; while in the
votaries, too, could live in houses of their own and dispose of their

in the forehead. That the social position enjoyed by a votary was
considerable is proved by the fact that many women of good family, and
It is a striking fact that women of an Eastern race should have

commercial enterprise, it would seem that the demand arose, on the
part of women of the upper class, to take part in activities in which
they considered themselves capable of joining.[35] The success of the

The administration of justice at the period of the First Dynasty was
carried out by duly appointed courts of law under the supervision of
upon any arbitrary administration of the law by the fact that the
elders of the city sat with them and assisted them in hearing and
sifting evidence. When once a judgment had been given and recorded, it
considered that justice had not been done, it was always open to him
but also over those which were tried in the other great cities of
Babylonia, and it is clear that he attempted to stamp out corruption
on the part of all those invested with authority. On one occasion he

The relations maintained by the king with the numerous classes of
throughout the country. Under the Sumerians there had always been a
tendency on the part of the more powerful members of the hierarchy to
usurp the prerogatives of the crown,[38] but this danger appears to
duty it probably was to make periodical reports to the king on the
conjunctions and movements of the heavenly bodies, with the object of
ascertaining whether they portended good or evil to the state. The
and we may conclude that the regulation of the calendar was carried out
in accordance with such advice. One of Hammurabi's letters has come
down to us in which he writes to inform Sin-idinnam, his local governor
of Larsa, that it had been decided to insert an intercalary month in
a deficiency, the month that was beginning was to be registered as
the second Elul; and he adds the very practical reminder, that the
insertion of the extra month would not justify any postponement in the
payment of the regular tribute due from the city of Larsa.[39] The
lunar calendar of the Babylonians rendered the periodical intercalation
of months necessary, in order that it should be made to correspond to
the solar year; and the duty of watching for the earliest appearance of
the new moon and fixing the first day of each month, was among the most
In the naming of the year the priesthood must also have played an
important part, since the majority of the events from which the
years were named were of a religious character. The system, which

Year's Feast, and, when the event commemorated in the formula was the

was named.[41] Often merely a provisional title was adopted from
the preceding formula, and then perhaps no ceremony of naming was

We have already seen that flocks and herds which were owned by the
great temples were sometimes pastured with those of the king, and there
is abundant evidence that the king also superintended the collection
of temple-revenues along with his own. Collectors of both secular and
ecclesiastical tribute sent reports directly to the king, and, if there
was any deficit in the supply expected from a collector, he had to make
it up himself. From one of Hammurabi's letters, for example, we gather

crops, refusing to pay the proportion due to Bît-il-kittim, the great

defaulting parties had to make good the loss and submit to fines or

protection. They were placed in charge of public works and looked after
and controlled the public slaves, and they probably also had a good
deal to do with the collection of the revenue. As payment for their

and swamps, which tended to increase where the rivers approached the

the success of their invasion may in large part be traced to their

rival states of Asia. By skilful diplomacy, and, particularly in
the reign of Akhenaten, by presents and heavy bribes, the Egyptian

Syria and Palestine. In paying liberal bounties and rewards to his

The historian of ancient Babylonia has reason to be grateful to
valley, since certain of the monuments they carried off as spoil have
been preserved in the mounds of Susa, until the French expedition
brought them again to light. Thanks to Babylon's misfortunes at this
time, we have recovered some of her finest memorials, including the
series of the Kassite kudurrus, or boundary-stones, which, as we
have seen, throw considerable light upon the economic condition of
the country. These doubtless represent but a small proportion of the
booty secured by Elam at this period, but they suffice to show the
manner in which the great Babylonian cities were denuded of their
treasures. Under the earlier kings of the Fourth Dynasty it would
seem that Elam continued to be a menace, and it was not until the
reign of Nebuchadnezzar I. that the land was freed from further
danger of Elamite invasion. We possess two interesting memorials of
territories, but carried the war into the enemy's country. One is a
charter of privileges, which the king conferred upon Ritti-Marduk, the
a series of divine symbols, sculptured in high relief, in order to
place the record under the protection of the gods, in accordance with

on the march. The heat of the sun was so great that, in the words of
as Captain of the chariots, encouraged the troops by his example, and
eventually brought them to the Euheus, where they gave battle to the
darkened. The hurricane sweeps along, the storm rages; in the storm of
their battle the warrior in the chariot perceives not the companion
at his side." Here again Ritti-Marduk did good service by leading the
attack. "He turned evil against the King of Elam, so that destruction
overtook him; King Nebuchadnezzar triumphed, he captured the land of
and villages of Bît-Karziabku, of which he was the head-man, from
the jurisdiction of the neighbouring town of Namar. In addition to
freedom from all taxation and the _corvée,_ the privileges secured the
The second memorial too has a bearing on this war, since it exhibits
Nebuchadnezzar as a patron of Elamite refugees. It is a copy of a
deed recording a grant of land and privileges to Shamfia and his
son Shamfiia, priests of the Elamite god Rîa, who, in fear of the
protection. The text states that, when the king undertook an expedition
on their behalf, they accompanied him and brought back the statue of
the god Rîa, whose cult Nebuchadnezzar inaugurated in the Babylonian

Babylonia must have been subject to further Elamite aggression, and

his northern frontier; and, when Ashur-rêsh-ishi attempted an invasion
of Babylonian territory, he not only drove the Assyrians back, but
and, on Nebuchadnezzar's return with reinforcements, the Babylonian
army suffered a further defeat, losing its fortified camp together with
Karashtu, the general in command of the army, who was taken to Assyria
as a prisoner of war. Babylon thus proved that, though strong enough to

strictly speaking, her scientific observations do not date from a
very early period. It is true we have evidence that, as early as the
text which shows that they attempted to measure approximately the
positions of the fixed stars. But their art of measuring remained for
a long time primitive, and it was only the later Babylonians, of the
period from the sixth to the first century B.C., who were enabled to
those of the moon, and by this means to found a reliable system of
time-measurement. The mere fact that the astrological texts, even in
the late Assyrian period, treat eclipses as possible on any day of
their regular occurrence and still had comparatively crude notions of

Babylonian religious system from an early period there can be no
doubt; but at that time the stars and planets did not exercise any
preponderating influence on religious belief, and many features of the

adoption of astral mythology from Babylon on the part of the writers or
times. But it is quite compatible with the view that some of the
